    "title": "About the event",
    "subtitle": "The invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine and the third year of full-scale war have become a shock that requires extraordinary efforts at the local government level to effectively respond to military threats and adapt life support systems to blackouts and other challenges. Community resilience is the ability of local governments and residents to survive, adapt, and grow, regardless of the long-term threats they face. <br><br><strong> Ukrainian Resilience Week </strong>  is a platform for expert discussions, inspiring stories, and promoting the interests of local governance in building resilience."
